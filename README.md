Hi. I am that one nerd that implements weirdly specific features into your software.

I primarily work with C#, but I also do C++, Lua, Python and sometimes JavaScript when I feel like torturing myself.

I enjoy game dev and have a variety of experiences with Unity, Unreal Engine and Godot. Currently writing my own game engine using Silk.NET for autistic reasons.
